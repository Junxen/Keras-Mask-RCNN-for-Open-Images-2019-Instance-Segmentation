Repository contains Mask R-CNN models which were trained on Kaggle competition data: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/open-images-2019-instance-segmentation/leaderboard 

Repository contains the following:
* Pre-trained Mask R-CNN models (ResNet50, ResNet101 and ResNet152 backbones)
* Example code to get predictions with these models for any set of images
* Code to train your own classifier based on Keras Mask R-CNN and OID dataset 

## Requirements

Python 3.\*, Keras 2.\*, [keras-maskrcnn 0.2.2](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-maskrcnn)

## Pretrained models
